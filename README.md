# Northeastern Husky Cup Fall 2022

This repository holds solutions to the problems in the Northeastern Husky Cup Fall 2022, a contest where all the problems in the contest were written by Northeastern students. If you have a CodeForces account (you can register at [codeforces.com](https://codeforces.com/)), you can view the Husky Cup Fall 2022 problems [using this invite link](https://codeforces.com/contestInvitation/702057893005c3758c257e92415258bf6b91a344).

All problems in the contest were written by Noble Mushtak, except for Problem E (Knight Rush), which was written by Jonathan Hsieh. All solutions in this repository were written in Python 3 (specifically, they were submitted to CodeForces under the language "PyPy 3-64", [Pypy](https://www.pypy.org/) is a fast alternative implementation of Python) by Noble Mushtak. The solution to each problem is named after the problem letter, e.g. the solution to Problem A is named `a.py` and the solution to Problem G is named `g.py`.
